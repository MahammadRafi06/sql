**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Incorporating ethics and equity components into my previous work as US Healthcare Busisness Analyst warrants ensuring that my queries reflect fairness, transparency, privacy, and inclusivity. On the Data Privacy and Security side, I would abide by the best pratices in Encryption, Access Controls and Anonymize data where possible. Often as SQL Developers we unitentionally create Bias in the data, so I regularly audit the data for biases that could lead to unfair outcomes and work on building Inclusive Datasets.

In terms of data collection, I would prioritize transparency and consent. In the past, we may have collected more data than necessary, which can infringe on user privacy. I will identify such data based on the usage and work on data minimization, collecting only the data that is absolutely necessary for the intended purpose. On transparency and accountability, We already have comprehensive automatic logging and auditing mechanisms. 

 I would ensure that my database designs are inclusive and accessible. For example, when designing schema fields for personal attributes like gender or ethnicity, I would use flexible data types that accommodate a wide range of identities and backgrounds. I would also ensure that my systems are accessible to users with disabilities by adhering to web accessibility standards. By incorporating these ethical and equity components into my SQL development practices, I can help create databases that not only perform well but also respect and protect the rights and interests of all users.
